# Jake's Homelab Setup

Welcome to my personal homelab — a hybrid dev, automation, and ethical hacking lab built for real-world testing, private media hosting, and leveling up IT skills from the ground up.

---

##  Overview

This setup powers my entire smart home, handles media and automation, and gives me a full-blown ethical hacking playground. It’s modular, secure, and fully documented.

## TrueNAS SCALE – Docker Stack (via Dockge)

> Managed using [Dockge](https://github.com/louislam/dockge)

| App          | Role                         |
|--------------|------------------------------|
| `qbittorrent` + `gluetun` | Private torrenting via VPN (Windscribe + WireGuard) |
| `sonarr`, `radarr`        | TV/movie automation (indexers + media management) |
| `jackett`                | Torznab indexer hub |
| `ombi` + `omnibot`       | Discord-integrated media requests |
| `heimdall`               | Dashboard for homelab apps |
| `speedtest`              | Scheduled network performance checks |

**Config Directory**: `/mnt/Drive1/Docakge/config`

## Plex Media Server

- Installed as a **TrueNAS SCALE App**
- Serves 5.1 audio and video content to local and remote clients
- Plex media folder: `/mnt/Drive1/Plex`

---

## Home Assistant OS (HAOS)

- Runs as a **VM** inside TrueNAS SCALE
- Fully isolated Home Assistant experience
- **Integrated Devices**:
  - Tuya smart lights
  - Pioneer VSX-LX305 (via Onkyo integration)
  - Blink cameras
- **Future Plans**:
  - iOS/macOS automations
  - Zigbee or MQTT support via Raspberry Pi bridge

---

## Raspberry Pi Services

- **Pi-hole** @ `192.168.0.200`  
  Central DNS + network-wide ad blocking

- **Portainer**  
  Container management GUI (managing Pi containers only)

---

## Ethical Hacking & Dev Toolkit (Gaming PC)

### Tools Installed:
- **VS Code** (with extensions):
  - Python
  - Docker
  - GitLens
  - GitHub Copilot (trial)
  - Remote SSH
- **Python 3.x** (`pip install requests`)
- **Docker + Docker Compose**
- **Postman**
- **Git + GitHub**
- **Kali Linux** 

### Kali Use Cases:
- Test exploits against Docker-based vulnerable apps
- Run Nmap, Burp Suite, SQLmap, Hydra, and Wireshark
- Store scripts and reports in a private GitHub repo
- SSH into Pi or TrueNAS to test remote exploits in the lab

---

## Network Infrastructure

- **DNS**: Pi-hole (`192.168.0.200`)
- **VPN**: Gluetun (WireGuard) routes qBittorrent traffic
- **SMB Shares**:
  - `/mnt/Drive1/Plex`
  - `/mnt/Drive1/QBittorrent/Downloads`
- **Permissions Fix**: Unified access for Plex, SMB, and Docker (via `mediaaccess` group)
